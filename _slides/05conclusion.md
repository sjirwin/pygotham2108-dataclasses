## Conclusion

- Dataclasses are new in Python 3.7
  - But the idea has been around for a while
- Originally described in [PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/)
- Reduces the effort needed to implement user-defined classes
  - Decorator and ```field``` function automatically add generated special methods
